# Sharepoint-Directory

Created by Timothy Simanhadi

### Description
A seamless directory tool created to help procurement analysts navigate their internal SharePoint without clicking a single button. Created for the Statewide Technical Procurement team at the California Department of Technology. Directory can go multiple levels deep, but this was outside of the scope of the project.  

NOTE: Images will not load unless user is logged into SharePoint
